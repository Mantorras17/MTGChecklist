This is the ultimate checklist for Magic: The Gathering the Trading Card Game.

It is done on an excel file and it is based on the scryfall.com card database, which inicludes every card from every edition ever printed (or atleast the vast majority of them), promos, tokens and more!

The document includes an index page which divides the editions and links them directly to ther respective checklist. Then, if you want to check a certain card, you just have to search it using 'ctr+f' or manualy scrolling.

Checklists include a check-box, card number, card name, type, and rarity of the card.

All of the cards are linked respectively to their page on scryfall.com and from there, it is possible to find them on various other buying platforms, toolboxes and databases.

Feel free to use and modify this document!
